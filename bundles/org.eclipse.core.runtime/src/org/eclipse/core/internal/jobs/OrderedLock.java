/**
 * A lock used to control write access to an exclusive resource.
 * 
 * The lock avoids circular waiting deadlocks by ensuring that locks
 * are always acquired in a strict order.  This makes it impossible for n such 
 * locks to deadlock while waiting for each other.  The downside is that this means
 * that during an interval when a process owns a lock, it can be forced
 * to give the lock up and wait until all locks it requires become
 * available.  This removes the feature of exclusive access to the
 * resource in contention for the duration between acquire() and
 * release() calls.
 * 
 * The lock implementation prevents starvation by granting the
 * lock in the same order in which acquire() requests arrive. In
 * this scheme, starvation is only possible if a thread retains
 * a lock indefinitely.
